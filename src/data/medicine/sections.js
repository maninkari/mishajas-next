        'Honorato and José Mishaja are some of the most renowned healers in the Ese-eja community of Infierno. They have worked for more than 20 years in the Ñape ethnobotanical centre, attending both local families of scarce resources and tourists from all around the world.',
        'Like many other traditional healers from the Amazon basin who have been using the plant for more than 5000 years, Honorato and José use Ayahuasca to diagnose and treat their patients. Following a strict diet during the treatment is key to let the plant deploy its healing and purifying visions.',
